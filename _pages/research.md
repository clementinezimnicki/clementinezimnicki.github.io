<p style="font-size:40px;"> how do people interpret data visualizations? </p>
<p style="font-size:30px;"> and how can we make it easier? </p>

the more intuitive a visualization is, the easier it is to understand what information is being communicated. but what does "intuitive" mean? what aspects of a visualization make it more or less intuitive? my research focuses on understanding these questions. research shows people have expectations about visualizations (even without looking at legends). knowing what these expectations are is key to designing visualizations that match them, and are therefore easy to interpret. making visualizations intuitive makes them more accessible.

below are some projects I've been working on during my time at UW-Madison.
