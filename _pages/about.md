<p style="font-size:40px;"> hi! </p>

<p style="font-size:20px;">I'm a graduate student researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. </p>

<p style="font-size:20px;">I work in the <a href="http://concepts.psych.wisc.edu/"><b>Knowledge and Concepts Lab</b></a>, where I study individual differences in color perception. 

In my 4+ years at UW-Madison, I have gained experience in experimental design (including survey design and A/B testing), programming, statistical analysis, and science communication. I have presented this research at several conferences, including Vision Sciences Society and IEEE VIS. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:20px;">In addition to my graduate program, I have recently (as of summer 2024) become an intern working at Sandia National Labs! There, I study how people interpret hazard maps (like maps of wildfires), and how the colors used in these maps affect people's evacuation choices, especially when there is uncertainty.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px;">Before graduate school, I completed a BS in Psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. There, I did research in Diane Beck's <a href="https://becklab.beckman.illinois.edu/"><b>Attention and Perception Lab</b></a>, where I used EEG to investigate alpha oscillations.</p>
