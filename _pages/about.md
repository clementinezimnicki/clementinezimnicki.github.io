<p style="font-size:40px;"> hi! </p>

<p style="font-size:20px;">I'm a graduate student researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. </p>

<p style="font-size:20px;">I work in the <a href="https://schlosslab.discovery.wisc.edu/">Schloss Visual Reasoning Lab</a>, where I study how people infer meaning about colors in visualizations. In the 3+ years I have spent here, I have gained experience in experimental design (including survey design and A/B testing), programming, statistical analysis, and science communication. I have presented this research at several conferences, including Vision Sciences Society and IEEE VIS. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:20px;">Before graduate school, I completed a BS in Psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. There, I did research in Diane Beck's <a href="https://becklab.beckman.illinois.edu/">Attention and Perception Lab</a>, where I used electroencephalograpy to investigate alpha oscillations. During my time there, I gained two years of experience in EEG methods, experimental design, A/B testing, and programming.</p>
