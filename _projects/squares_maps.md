<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1559/152304089783813918">Visualization research</a> shows that people expect darker regions on maps to mean larger quantities (this is commonly referred to as the dark-is-more bias). My first project as a graduate student aimed to clarify which situations the dark-is-more bias applied to, and if it was limited to visualizations. In a series of 4 experiments, I found that the dark-is-more bias affected people's interpretations of abstract shapes: that is, people expect darker shapes (specifically squares) to mean "more." I also found that when squares look more opaque, people expect them to mean larger quantities relative to squares that look transparent. 

Here we expect people to pick the darker square as meaning more:

Here, we expect people to pick the lighter (more opaque!) square as meaning more:
