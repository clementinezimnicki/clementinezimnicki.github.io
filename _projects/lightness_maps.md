The dark-is-more bias relies on people being able to tell that there are darker and lighter areas in a visualization--i.e., a visualization must vary in lightness. Based on previous research, we also know that people have trouble seeing variation in lightness when there is also variation in hue (to test this, just try to match two different color swatches on their lightness; you'll likely find it very hard).
